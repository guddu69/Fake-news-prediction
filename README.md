# Fake-news-prediction

This project is aimed at developing and evaluating machine learning models for the detection of fake news articles. 
We utilized a diverse dataset to train three popular classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). 
These models are designed to distinguish between legitimate news articles and deceptive or misleading content. 
We conducted extensive text preprocessing, including TF-IDF vectorization, to transform textual data into numerical features. 
Our analysis also includes a comparative performance assessment of these algorithms to determine which one excels in fake news prediction. 
Whether you're interested in understanding the intricacies of fake news detection or seeking a benchmark for your own text classification tasks, this project provides valuable insights into the world of misinformation identification.
